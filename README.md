# CLASS FILES SLAYER

### Description
Here's a little python program that deletes the annoying CLASS files when you're coding in JAVA. It's deleting the files which are in the folder you specify and those in the folders of your folder. Â 

### Use project

The project only uses the time and os packages. 

To Launch the project just go to the folder where the file is stored and execute the command line below (in a command prompt window)
```
python ClassFilesSlayer.py
```
After being launched the program will ask you about what folder you want to delete the files from. Now you just got to enter the folder address as specified below
```
folder to track:\Users\Utilisateur\Downloads
```
Don't mind about the 'Utilisateur' it's because I'm French. If you have any problem or questions you can contact me by [mail](poire.erwan2005@gmail.com).
