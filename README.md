# CLASS FILES SLAYER

### Description
Here's a little python program that deletes the annoying CLASS files when you're coding in JAVA. It's deleting the files which are in the folder you specify and those in the folders of your folder.  

### Use project
After being launched the program will ask you about what folder you want to delete the files from. Now you just got to enter the folder address as specified below
```
folder to track:\Users\Utilisateur\Downloads
```
Don't mind about the 'Utilisateur' it's because I'm French. If you have any problem or questions you can contact me by [mail](poire.erwan2005@gmail.com).
